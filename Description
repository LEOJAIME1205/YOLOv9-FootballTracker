FootballVision-YOLOv9 is a project that leverages the YOLOv9 deep learning model to perform real-time object detection in football (soccer) matches.
This repository contains the code for training the YOLOv9 model on a custom football dataset and applying the trained model to video footage of football games to detect and track players, ball, and other relevant objects.

**Features:**
- Training scripts for YOLOv9 on football datasets
- Real-time object detection on football match videos
- Pre-trained YOLOv9 weights for football detection
- Code for processing and annotating video frames
- Example notebooks for getting started with model training and inference

**Usage:**
1. Train the YOLOv9 model on your custom football dataset.
2. Use the trained model to detect objects in football match videos in real-time.
3. Visualize and analyze the detection results.

**Installation:**
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FootballVision-YOLOv9.git
cd FootballVision-YOLOv9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Getting Started:**
Refer to the [notebooks](notebooks) directory for example scripts and detailed instructions on how to train the model and run inference on video data.
